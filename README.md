# Mosaic

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for console UI. Inspired by [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).


## Usage

Can't do much yet. For now, run `./gradlew installDist` to build a binary and then run
`./mosaic/build/install/mosaic/bin/mosaic`. Must be run on its own to correctly detect
that your terminal supports ANSI control sequences.
